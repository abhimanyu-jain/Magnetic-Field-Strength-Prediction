# Magnetic-Field-Strength-Prediction

Introduction

This project aims to predict magnetic field strength based on historical data. 3 satellites measured magnetic field strength at various points around the earth over several years.

The points around the earth are represented with the following Geomagnetic coordinates:

1. L value https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-shell
2. Magnetic Local Time (MLT) 
3. Magnetic Latitude (MLAT)

Time is represented using Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute and Second.


 AL index and KP index are commonly used magnetic activity indices.

Satellite flag represents which satellite took the reading.

Bw is the output, also called the Magnetic Flux Density https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux.
